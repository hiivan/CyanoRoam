# How to Install

2. Create a bullet point named CyanoRoam (or any name you like).
3. Make a subbullet and type /Code Block. 
4. Copy and paste my css into this code block.

    This is how it should look like

5. Set the code language on the upper right corner of the code block to `css` (it is `clojure` by default). The theme should be applied!

# How to Customize
You may play around with the colours, font weight and hover functions.

You can also scroll down to the end to change the customized data-tags (credit to Maggie Appleton: Follow her twitter on [@mappletons](https://twitter.com/mappletons)).
