# CyanoRoam
Custom (cyan/teal based) CSS and JavaScript theme for <a href="https://roamresearch.com" target="_blank">Roam Research</a>, a note-taking app. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/hiivan/CyanoRoam/blob/master/CyanoRoam.css" target="_blank">CyanoRoam.css</a> file and the <a href="https://github.com/hiivan/CyanoRoam/tree/master/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> folder.

Inspired and built on top of <a href="https://github.com/kanjun/roam-beautified" target="_blank">Roam Beautified</a> created by Github user <a href="https://github.com/kanjun" target="_blank">Kanjun</a>.

# How to Install
**CSS**
1. Create a new page called [[roam/css]] in Roam Research.
2. Create a bullet point and copy & paste `CyanoRoam` (or any name you like) in it.
3. Create a subbullet. Either type in '/Code Block', or and copy & paste '```'.
4. Copy and paste the code inside the CyanoRoam.css file into this code block.

    This is how it should look like

1. Create a new page called [[roam/js]] in Roam Research.
2. Create a bullet point and copy & paste `{{[[roam/js]]}}`.
3. Create a subbullet. Either type in '/Code Block', or and copy & paste '```'.
4. Copy and paste the code inside either one of the JavaScript file into this code block.
5. Set the code language on the upper right corner of the code block to `javascript` (it is `clojure` by default). Allow the script to run!
